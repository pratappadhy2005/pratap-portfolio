        I have worked on a variety of backend development projects, ranging from
        RESTFUL APIs for small business applications to full-stack enterprise solutions
        and scalable microservices using Java and Spring Boot. My experience includes
        designing robust backend architectures, integrating databases, implementing security layers,
        and deploying applications to cloud environments.
